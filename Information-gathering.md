# Passive information gathering
In this section we will learn about different methods that we can use to gather useful information about our target. This is the first step and it is very important because without this kind of informations we could not proceed for the penetration testing. This is called passive because we will just look for legal informations that we can find in the internet without compromising the target system. 

For all the commands enumerate here you can use cmd : <whatis> for a better understanding.
